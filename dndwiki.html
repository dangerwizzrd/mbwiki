      <h2 id="char-header" class="char-header">Rollo Vrinn</h2>
      <h3 id="rollo_background">Background</h3>
      <p>Born with his twin brother Jarric to Vila and Xalen Viziir of An'draath, Rollo had already started life as an
        outcast. In the matriarchal society of the drow, giving birth to a boy is bad luck, but to have twin boys is
        seen
        as
        a baleful curse cast upon your House. Vila was stripped of her social status within the Hel Knights, and Xalen
        was
        castrated and exiled from An’draath to avoid further “failures.” Needless to say, family life was tense for
        Rollo
        and Jarric, who were more often than not just left on their own while their parents wallowed in misery.
        As young boys, they often spent their free time scavenging for fungi to eat, as their parents could usually
        barely
        managed to eke out more than 1 full meal each day for the growing boys. One day Jarric led Rollo to a hidden
        away
        cavern, kept out of sight by a narrow entrance. Within the cavern was wall to wall luminous fungi, ripe for the
        picking. As Jarric began to climb up to begin picking, his foot set off a glyph, which started lighting up
        underneath all the fungi. Before Jarric could get down, it unleashed a blast that buried him, blasted the cavern
        open, and sent Rollo flying unconscious back into town. As small rumbles began to cascade into more massive
        tremors,
        long-hidden pathways opened up into the city, unleashing hordes of vicious monsters and mutants. The Hel Knights
        were able to defeat this seemingly random wave of attackers but at significant cost. The monstrosities had made
        their way into town and killed several villagers and guards.
        The blast had left Rollo nearly comatose for weeks, and by the time he woke up, his brother had been pronounced
        dead, and his parents had disowned him entirely. While he was out, the decision had been made to make him a ward
        of
        the Elder Sage Aldnis Corealia. Aldnis felt pity for the young Rollo and seemed to sense great power within him.
        This proved right when Rollo turned 13, and his shadow magic began to develop, at times quite explosively. This
        only
        served to further distance Rollo from his fellow citizens, who, at this point, seemed to feel nothing but scorn
        for
        the "Accursed Son." Life had been hard enough with his mother's neglect, and even then, he still had Jarric.
        Now,
        it
        seemed, Rollo was truly alone. </p>

      <p>The next two centuries became an exercise in restraint as Rollo trained to center himself and contain his
        emotions
        while honing his control over his shadow magic. Aldnis helped guide the young Sorcerer’s training, and gave him
        a
        somewhat stable home, despite his own low status within the city. Growing up, Rollo also knew kindness from
        Tabitha,
        the daughter of the Archmistress. While aloof and cold to almost everyone else in town, Tabitha always seemed to
        reject the notion of Rollo’s outcast status. While the two weren’t bosom buddies by any means, Tabitha showed
        Rollo
        genuine respect that he otherwise would have never known from anyone else.
        Others, like her husband Boyzon, made a point to do more than just scorn, Rollo, instead actively tormenting him
        for
        many years as children. Boyzon’s mother had been killed in the surprise attack, and he had spent his life
        blaming
        Rollo for it. Boyzon’s favorite pass-time was lobbing rocks at Rollo as he walked by, which seemed to only get
        more
        significant as the years went on. One day, while particularly high on dust, Boyzon stalked Rollo through the
        streets, before finding and lobbing a massive stone directly at his head. Boyzon woke up three days later,
        terrified
        of Rollo, with a large scar running down his face between his eyes. Aldnis was the only other witness to what
        happened, and neither he nor Boyzon has ever said what happened. Rollo, for his part, does not remember anything
        from that day. </p>

      <p>As word spread of Rollo’s dark powers, much of the direct harassment subsided. However, Rollo still felt the
        intense isolation of everyday life amongst people who either fear or scorn your very existence. For the next two
        centuries, Rollo’s life coasted along, studying magic while doing the grunt work of a Sage who acted more as
        government employee than a collector of eldritch knowledge. One day, Aldnis and Rollo detected a disturbance in
        an
        outer cavern, one populated by many of the monstrosities that had cause Rollo so much of this grief. The two
        mages
        used a scrying spell to see a group of seven strange surface-folk, fighting their way through these hordes of
        monsters.
        After sending Rollo out to help these strange men, he brought them back to the Sage’s Sanctum to recuperate and
        meet
        with Aldnis. This group, calling themselves the God Slayers, was a surly bunch alleging to have fallen
        underground
        after fighting a vampire. Claims of time travel and ancient gods of destruction were thrown around, but their
        main
        point was simple, they wanted to get home. Rollo and this group were sent into a sealed away network of caverns
        to
        find the necessary components to fire up a long-dormant gate to the surface. After a strange and ambling
        journey,
        they were able to gather the required parts to restart the gate, which opened up into the basement of the Royal
        Palace of Aesi’ir. Aldnis urged Rollo to leave An'draath for the surface, and see the world for himself. With
        nothing left for him in An'draath, Rollo took the advice and stepped over the threshold into a whole new world.
        After a wild encounter in the dungeons beneath Aesi’ir against a Void Beast, Rollo and company were teleported
        to
        the island metropolis Tanil’i. He spent the next year traveling with the God Slayers as they dealt with a series
        of
        complex personal issues. After helping Grak Greenfaith reclaim his original Half-Orc body, Rollo went to Redhill
        to
        see the legendary Herald’s Tree. When he arrived, he met two sailors, October Tengu, and Rook Sands, who soon
        became
        caught up with him in a were-tiger hunt. After saving the town from two villagers turned were-tigers, a local
        mystic
        provided Rollo with a prophecy:</p>

      <blockquote><i>Accursed Sons, cleft in twain,
          <br>
          lost, alone, a heart profane.
          <br>
          Now above your world below,
          <br>
          seeking a cure for your endless woe.
          <br>
          Secrets revealed, the two of hearts,
          <br>
          together again from worlds apart.
          <br>
          But when a black moon meets the ground,
          <br>
          the one you lost may now be found.</i></blockquote>

      <p>Having spent nearly three centuries of life steeped in disappointment, Rollo didn’t want to get his hopes up.
        However, he couldn’t help but see this as hope that Jarric might still be out there alive somewhere. Since then,
        Rollo has traveled up and down Uldura searching for his lost brother.</p>

      <h3 id="rollo_appearance">Appearance</h3>
      <p>Rollo is a tall thin Drow man, with not-quite shoulder length platinum hair and a dark aubergine complexion.
        Rollo has what some might call “resting b*tch face” and a dangerous side-eye. Since the accident that took his
        brother, the whites of Rollo’s eyes have turned dark black. Despite how odd this might make him look, Rollo is
        exceptionally handsome, even for a dark elf.</p>

        <p>Rollo is quite sartorial, with a wardrobe full of self-made couture clothing. He most often wears a billowing
        poet’s shirt, high-waisted dark pants and low top boots. He wears a fair amount of fine and funky jewelry, with
        multiple necklaces and rings also of his own making. Draped across Rollo’s shoulders is a gorgeous glimmering
        robe of cobalt blue and purple silks, with a lining that looks like a night’s sky with gleaming four-point stars
        all along it. It has a tall collar up to Rollo’s jawline and a glimmering trim.

      <h2 id="char-header" class="char-header">Tabitha Xilton</h2>
      <h3 id="tabitha_background">Background</h3>
      <p>Born in the Lost City of An'draath, Tabitha Mal’achi Xoffi (née Xilton) was born to Thalma and Darriq Xilton,
        two
        prominent members of Zovenia Mistral’s inner circle, herself the Matriarch of An’draath. Tabitha’s father worked
        as the Royal Physician, while her mother bore the title of Archmistress, otherwise known as the left hand of the
        Matriarch. Though Tabitha’s relationship with her mother was often tense, as fierce warriors of the Underdark,
        they had great respect for one another. Darriq took care of most of the child-rearing in the family and, to this
        day, loves the two women in his life more than life itself. While her father’s submissive stature in his and
        Thalma’s relationship always bothered her, she knew her mother did truly love Darriq in kind. Each trained her
        in
        their areas-of-expertise, so while Thalma taught Tabitha how to kill, it was Darriq who taught her how to heal.
        To
        most anyone in An’draath Tabitha was known as a prodigy, a mighty paladin likely to take her mother’s place as
        Archmistress one day. But despite the many privileges she enjoyed, life in the hellish prison of the Underdark
        still had its challenges for the young Lady.</p>

      <p>The caverns of the Underdark teem with all kinds of mutants and monsters, and as such, most women have to join
        the
        military and help protect their people. Tabitha was trained in the ways of the warrior from a very young age,
        tutored by her domineering mother. Thalma knew the cutthroat reality that lay right outside the palace walls and
        did her damnedest to make her daughter prepared. Despite her languid, dancer-ly gait, Tabitha was a natural with
        a
        sword, and by age 42 had felled more monsters than any other girl her age. On her 86th birthday, Tabitha was
        inducted as a Hel Knight, sworn protectors of the Matriarch, and all her subjects. Though some took issue with
        her
        quick advancement, Tabitha was an exceptional fighter and was nearly as well versed in holy magic. She took
        command of her first unit at the age of 169, the youngest in the city’s history, before being chosen as the
        Matriarch’s Personal Guardian 60 years later. This position, a prestigious honor for any Hel Knight, was, in
        actuality, a mind-numbingly tedious job. Her new unit was confined mostly within the palace walls, which meant
        she
        was as well.
        None-the-less, Tabitha had grown up close to Matriarch Zovenia, whom she knew as her “Aunt Zovi.” She long
        missed
        her days of monster-slaying, despite the genuine honor it was to be entrusted with her beloved Matriarch’s life.
      </p>

      <p>Despite living as an otherwise acceptable member of the noble class, Tabitha could not help but find small ways
        to rebel against it. Tabitha suffered no fools amongst the nobility of An’draath and was dutifully kind to those
        with little power of their own. Her cold exterior can intimidate many, but those who know her understand that
        beneath it all is a righteous and loving heart. Because Tabitha was born into the noble House Xilton, she was
        not
        allowed to socialize in regular circles as a child. For a long time, Tabitha had only one friend amongst the
        stuffy nobility, Lady Zivana “Ana” Mistral, the daughter of the Matriarch. Aside from Ana, the only other "real"
        friend she had growing up was Boyzon Xoffi, whose father would often bring him along on deliveries made to
        Tabitha’s father. His father was a lousy alchemist, but thankfully good enough to teach Boyzon, who was a
        prodigy
        at the magical art. His mother was a decorated soldier who had died in a mutant invasion caused by an incident
        involving Rollo Vrinn and his twin brother Jarric.
        Boyzon supplied Tabitha and Zivana with drugs like Dust, a depressant made of fermented bone meal, which helped
        keep him within their inner circle and close to Tabitha. The two dated for over 60 years, eventually deciding to
        marry and move out to The Webs. Before their ceremony, Tabitha gave Boyzon an ultimatum that if they were to
        stay
        together, he must stop terrorizing Rollo Vrinn like a childish bully. Boyzon had a long-running hatred of Rollo,
        due to his mother’s untimely death, but ultimately relented out of love for Tabitha. In a bucking of drow
        tradition and her greatest insubordination against her mother, Tabitha chose to take on Boyzon’s family name,
        rather than him taking the far-more-prestigious Xilton name.
      </p>

      <p>One night after a family dinner with her parents, Thalma Xilton died in her sleep. All of An'draath fell into
        mourning after attempts to raise her failed. While searching for Thalma’s prized dagger Widowermaker, for her
        funeral, Tabitha returned home to find a sending stone in the belongings of Boyzon. In it were messages from a
        person saved in the stone as “Daddy” instructing Boyzon to kill Thalma, “collect a sample,” and steal the
        dagger.
        Boyzon was supposed to make contact with this “Daddy,” who would then reward him with a new life on the surface.
        Tabitha heard Boyzon return home and hid amongst the shadows, as he began to pack, looking for his Sending
        Stone.
        The only thing he found that night was Tabitha’s blade in his back, piercing his heart and killing him
        instantly.
        Tabitha quickly brought his body to her mother’s home on the palace grounds, burying him in an open plot in
        Thalma’s overgrown fungi garden. With only a few messages and a name to track this person down, Tabitha snuck
        into
        the Matriarch’s palace and through the Gate to the surface world. She left only a note for her father and Aunt
        Zovi with a brief (and incomplete) explanation of her absence. From that day forward, Tabitha now had only one
        mission in life: to find & kill Daddy.

      <h2 id="char-header" class="char-header">Preston Caviar</h2>
      <h3 id="preston_background">Background</h3>
      <p>Shawn Gilman was born to Mike and Terry Gilman, the second child in a large family of Merfolk in the underwater
        city of Icthydelphia. He grew up the oldest boy of ten children, and as such, frequently felt overlooked by his
        family. Shawn was a handful from a young age, often getting into trouble with older boys and other
        ne’er-do-wells
        across Fishtown. This behavior greatly strained his relationship with parents, who he felt resented his
        existence.
        Shawn also struggled in his classes and eventually dropped out two years before graduation. He felt he had
        learned
        everything school had to offer him and, after a particularly physical fight with his father, was kicked out of
        his
        parents’ home. Despite this tumultuous-ness, most of his siblings loved him dearly, knowing him as a kind
        hearted
        and goofy older brother. His younger brother Patrick always particularly admired Shawn, and continued to try and
        see Shawn long after he moved out.</p>

      <p>Now on the streets, Shawn learned quickly that he would need more than just his affinity for petty crime to
        survive on his own. While he wasn’t born rich, he had at least been born pretty and soon found ways to lean into
        it. Life as a street hustler brought much excitement and trouble for the young mer, whose good looks still were
        not enough to keep him out of handcuffs. Realizing that small cons and pick-pocketing were getting too risky,
        Shawn soon switched to a “steadier” form of hustling as a male prostitute. Shawn lived like this for years,
        eventually working his way up to regular gigolo work for the old, rich and lonely. </p>

      <p>Two years before the start of his surface-world adventures, Shawn’s life changed forever when he met Langston
        and
        Luther Cod, two investment brokers and old money socialites at a party for Icthydelphia’s elite. Langston took
        an
        immediate liking to him and his strange, affable charm.

        The brothers took the formerly kept-man and gave him a job, salary, a penthouse suite, and all the other
        luxuries
        money can buy. Most importantly they gave him a new identity and a new lease on life as Preston Caviar.

        6 months ago, the Cod Brothers went suddenly missing without a trace. With the police closing in on Preston as
        their prime suspect he made a hasty escape into an abandoned church on the north side of Icthy. With no where
        left
        to go, Preston fell to his knees and began to pray. He didn’t believe a word of it, but somehow still received
        an
        answer, in the form of powerful arcane abilities. These powers helped him evade capture and exit the city via an
        abandoned bathysphere on the outskirts of town, shown to him in visions.</p>

      <p>As he slept during his hours long journey to the surface, Preston had strange dreams of an Aurelia, Matron of
        the Seas, the powerful Archfey who’s dilapidated temple he had hidden in. She told Preston only to find her.

        Since then Preston has traveled the surface in hopes of finding the Cod Brothers with his friends October and
        Tabitha. He also recently tried drug dealing for the first time.</p>

      <h2 id="char-header" class="char-header">October Tengu</h2>
      <h3 id="october_background">Background</h3>
      <p>October and his twin sister November were born to Rick and Cheryl Tengu in the city of Emladrés, the Desert
        Rose.
        As Beastfolk, October and his sister were often bullied by the humans they went to school with, and got little
        protection from many of their similarly ignorant teachers. October taught himself martial arts from reading
        guide
        books in the school library, and watching tournaments at Gladefellow stadium every year for his birthday, until
        he
        finally became strong enough to stick up for himself and his sister in late high school. Since that day
        October’s
        goal has been to become powerful enough to protect his loved ones no matter what stands in his way.
        Finding his growth as a martial artist stifled by lack of training available in Emladrés, October joined the
        crew
        of a merchant vessel at the age of 17. He set out to see the world and train to become the most powerful martial
        artist in Eos.</p>
      <p>Having traveled to Tanil’i Island with his new friends Tabitha and Preston, October found a dojo not but a few
        minutes from their hotel lodgings. Inside he met a strange old dwarf named Shu Cinderhair. The raggedy old hippy
        offered to teach October, as he saw vast potential within him. Within a month of training with Shu, October had
        managed to activate his Elemental Overdrive at-will, the fastest Shu had ever seen. Now Shu wants to reform a
        group of heroes he once belonged to, the “Primordial Guardians.”</p>

      <p>Suplex was born as Drenk Nuut, raised as a scavenger in the Drowning Mire swamps by the Chief Scrounger, Urtejj
        Nuut. Like most goblins of his size, Suplex was used to squeeze into all manner of horrifying situations to
        gather
        materials for his clan. Eventually, he became skilled at slinking and sliding through dangerous situations, and
        gave up scavenging for life as a cutpurse in the central swamp cities of Ogzos. It was there he first met his
        mentor Zolda Yerrt, a fellow pack runt and an old witch. She hired Drenk to steal some of the more expensive
        components for her, and in exchange, taught him some rudimentary magic.</p>
      <p>The two enjoyed this mutually beneficial relationship for quite some time, until Urtejj came to town, having
        finally tracked Drenk down after a long and arduous search. Urtejj and his boys gave Drenk a public thrashing
        before Zolda found out and intervened. Zolda claimed Drenk as her apprentice seer, and in doing so, outranked
        Urtejj. With him now officially her apprentice, Zolda began to take his arcane studies more seriously. She
        taught
        him the ways of divination and how to read and manipulate portents of fate.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long for things to go wrong, when soon after that, Zolda gave her Warchief an unfavorable
        prediction and was set for execution. Slipping through the gang forming around the bugbears that had bound and
        dragged Zolda through the streets, Drenk created a magical distraction of himself shitting in public. This
        distracted the dull-minded bugbears long enough for the real Drenk to slip in and free Zolda. The two were
        chased
        for hours into the swamplands, only to finally lose their trackers as night fell.</p>
      <p>The next morning the two goblins continue slowly out into the deserts outside of Astramorn. Magically
        disguising
        themselves as Gnomes, they hitched a ride with a nearby caravan. The two slipped through the border into the
        City
        of Mages, where they immediately took to the slums, settling in an abandoned water tower. For the next few
        years,
        the two lived in relative peace, with Drenk taking on the name of Suplex Hammerthorn and disguising themselves
        when out and about. Suplex supported them through good ol’ fashion thievery. At the same time, Zolda made money
        as
        a fortune-teller known as the “Gran Swami,” who became popular amongst the children of Motown. For the first
        time
        in his existence, Suplex had a relatively normal life, and something kind of like a family. He was happy.
        It didn’t last.</p>
      <p>One night, after pickpocketing all day long, Suplex went to get Zolda and walk home from her Gran Swami gig. As
        their magical disguises began to fade, they began ducking through alleyways. Rounding a corner, they were
        stopped
        by a man mugging a woman who stabbed her while trying to grab her purse. The woman still fought with her life to
        hold onto her bag, as Suplex and Zolda blasted the thief with magic, causing him to run. Suplex ran to the
        woman,
        who was quickly bleeding out, as a few citizens ran over to see what the commotion was about. In her final act,
        the woman handed her bag to Suplex, begging him to run. The humans who stumbled upon them began to accuse the
        goblins of the mugging and called for help. Echoing the now dead woman’s sentiments, Zolda told Suplex to run,
        as
        guards arrived and began to take her into custody. Darting through the alleyways, Suplex managed to avoid
        capture,
        but he could feel the heat closing in on him. Back at their water tank hide-away, Suplex went through the purse,
        finding an airship ticket to Breakwater, a wallet, and a necklace. The necklace was strange, with a solid
        crystal
        pendant like a four-point star with clockwork gears around it.
        A few hours later, Zolda managed to send one last magical message to him before she was imprisoned.</p>

      <blockquote> “Get outta town and lay low for a while, kid! But please, don’t forget about me.”
        <br>
        “I’m fuckin’ serious!”</blockquote>

      <p>Unsure of what lies before him, Suplex took a few trinkets and what he had on him and made his way to the
        docks.
        Forging his assumed name onto the ticket, he boarded a ship and left for Uldura, the Savage County.</p>

      <p>Gaabi doesn’t remember much from before his death. 5 years before the beginning of the story Gaabi awoke on
        board
        a ghost ship set adrift aimlessly at sea. The entire crew dead, Gaabi wandered the ship, finding only a more
        powerful malevolent force below deck locked away. Still fearing what it was down there, Gaabi wittled away his
        time playing chess by himself and drawing crude cartoons, until one day he found his ship on a collision course
        for another one, headed to the island metropolis of Tanil’i.
        When the two ships collided Gaabi found his vessel boarded by three strangers, who soon introduced themselves as
        Preston Caviar, October Tengu, and Gaabi’s soon to be best friend, Tabitha Xoffi. His three new friends made
        short
        work of the malevolent forces within the ship, and with Gaabi’s help they were able to separate the two boats
        and
        lift the fallen mast back onto the ghost ship before Preston magically mended it. Gaabi followed the three back
        to
        their original vessel so they could collect payment for their deeds. Their Gaabi saw the unconscious body of
        Dave
        Kolinski, who had be knocked down by the mast during the crash. Gaabi quickly took advantage and possessed Dave,
        and decided to join his new friends back on the ghost ship, where they sailed off to their next destination
        together, Tanil’i City.
        Gaabi has since become very close to Tabitha, who finds him physically revolting, but none the less a trusted
        confidant and friend.
        Born in a small village outside of Ogzos, the City of Screams to it chieftain Garuq and one of his many “den
        mother” concubines. </p>

      <h2 id="char-header" class="char-header">Kris Pringle</h2>
      <h3 id="kris_background">Background</h3>
      <p>Kristof Kornelius Pringle was born under a shooting star on the island of Tanil’i, to his single mother
        Kolleen.
        His father was said to have been an exceptionally handsome moon elf man with piercing eyes. Kolleen remembers
        only
        spending a few nights with him, only to find him gone the next day. Without even a name, Kris’s mother was never
        able to find this man, instead opting to raise Kris on her own.</p>
      <p>With no extended family to support them, Kolleen was truly on her own raising Kris, which on the island of
        Tanil’i
        proved exceptionally expensive, even while working as a secretary for the largest corporation in the world,
        GraxAlthor. Making matters worse, Kris was an incredibly sickly child up until the age of 12, almost dying
        several
        times, and requiring expensive medical attention. Thanks to the insurance provided by Kolleen’s job, Kris was
        able
        to get the care he needed, and eventually grew up to be a healthy young man. Unfortunately by the time Kris was
        well, his mother had found herself in ill health, wasting away and becoming quite sick herself. Eventually
        unable
        to work, Kris has had to take on odd jobs to support them and afford his mothers increasingly expensive
        medicines,
        teaching himself magic on his own from books borrowed from the library.</p>
      <p>A few months ago, Kris found himself kidnapped by a gang of hostile Drow. Tabitha Xoffi and her friend Gaabi
        broke
        into the drow’s compound and freed Kris, who helped them defeat his captors. Since then Kris has followed
        Tabitha
        and her friends around, looking for adventure to help pay for his mother’s medical bills and hone his magical
        power.</p>
      <p>Unbeknownst to Kris or his Mother, the identity of Kris’s father is the god of Magic and Knowledge, Ovos the
        All-Seer. Wishing to experience mortal life for a time after millennia spent as a god, Ovos siphoned his
        consciousness into a mortal form, who then got drunk and decided to tango with the impressionable Ms. Kolleen
        Pringle at the Rusty Nail in Tanil’i. Ovos seemed muted, though in reality the massive amount of knowledge
        stored
        in the mind of the All-Seer short circuited his mortal sized brain, leaving him unable to speak for a time. This
        man left town in a haze, eventually leaving to adventure with a group of strange and rude men, known to some as
        The God Slayers.</p>
      <p>Since then Kris has found himself to be a more than capable wizard even without the proper training. What he
        doesn’t know, is that there is massive battery of arcane power stored within him, set to unleash should the boy
        ever find himself in mortal danger.</p>

      <h2 id="char-header" class="char-header">Zolda Yerrt</h2>
      <h3 id="zolda_background">Background</h3>
      <p>Zolda Yerrt was born on a humid day in 1345 a.d. to Zorrek Yerrt and a hobgoblin mother from a breeding den as
        the runt of her litter. Zolda was gifted with foresight from a young age, and was trained as a Seer by the elder
        witches in her tribe. Eventually she made enough of a name for herself to be moved from the outer reaches of the
        swamps to the city of Ogzos, where she was employed by Warchiefs to portend unseen attacks from the many hostile
        states surrounding the swamp.</p>
      <p>Zolda built as good a reputation as can be expected in Goblin society, and was well known around the city for
        her
        prowess in the magical art of Divination. Even still, she was often the bearer of bad news to the many Warchiefs
        who would call on her services. Because of this she was hardly popular amongst the elite, and a few times even
        had
        to go into hiding until those Warchiefs chilled the "F" out.</p>
      <p>Soon Zolda met Suplex, a local thief, and tasked him with acquiring expensive and rare components for use in
        her
        spell casting. As payment she would teach him basic magic, which the young goblin took to quickly. Despite his
        often outlandish and brash behavior, Zolda saw great potential in the boy. She took him under her wing as an
        apprentice, and began to teach him as a fully fledged wizard.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Zolda's luck with the Warchiefs ran out for good, and after a particularly unsavory prediction for
        Warchief Zuul Garjevv, she found herself being dragged out into public to be executed. Using his newly learned
        magic, Suplex managed to distract her captors with a rather grisly fecal illusion, and dove into danger in order
        to gran her and run. It took over a week for them to successfully sneak through the Drowning Mire unseen, but
        soon
        the pair had managed to escape and sneak through the border into Astramorn.</p>
      <p>Living with Suplex in the magical city of Astramorn, the two became even closer, relying on each other to
        survive
        in a place hostile to Goblins. Zolda masqueraded as a gnome street magician while Suplex snuck through the
        streets
        pick-pocketing. Zolda, normally only concerned with her own well being, unexpectedly began to feel a motherly
        affection for her young apprentice. The two lived together in an abandoned water tank outside of Motown in the
        lower circle, managed a few years together as a weird make-shift family. Unfortunately it was never meant to
        last.
        The two were separated during a mugging gone bad that they tried to stop. While Suplex got away, Zolda was taken
        in and arrested for the crime that she did not commit. </p>
